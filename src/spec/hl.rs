//! High-level memory state machine & high level specifications.
//!
//! To prove an implementationâ€™s correctness we need to ask what we mean
//! by correctness. The application specification is a state machine encoding our
//! answer to that question.
//!
//! This specification represents the proof target. Our implementation running
//! in the intended environment should refine it. This is demonstrated in part
//! by the proof that the OS-level state machine refines this specification.
