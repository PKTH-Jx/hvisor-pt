//! Hardware-level memory state transition specification.
//!
//! The hardware-level state transition is specified by several operations. The actual hardwareâ€™s
//! behavior must be a refinement of this specification.
//!
//! Hardware state transition step includes:
//!
//! - Memory read & write
//! - Page table memory operation
//! - TLB fill & evict.
